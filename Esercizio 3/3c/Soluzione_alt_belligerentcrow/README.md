This solution :
- Checks the given arguments
- If the character is a letter, it finds the opposite case of the letter (es: a->A, A->a), and it sets a boolean as true.
- It opens the file by file descriptor with the open() function
- I then create a stat structure to store file metadata
  - used to check if the file is regular, and for the size of the file
- I map the file with mmap in read mode and with MAP_PRIVATE since changes to the files aren't needed
- I check if the given character is a letter or not. By that condition, there are two possible (exclusive) loops. 
  - One looks for both cases of a letter, the other one is only entered if a character is not a letter, and only looks for the given character (for example, punctuation, or a bracket).
- The program unmaps the mapped file, cleans up, and exits.
- Inside the run.sh file there are two examples, the program will look for a letter and a punctuaton mark.
